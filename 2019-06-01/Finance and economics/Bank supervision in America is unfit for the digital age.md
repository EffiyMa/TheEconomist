# Bank supervision in America is unfit for the digital age 
##### Complexity favours incumbents, large and small, over startups

HERE COME the Germans. On May 21st Raisin, a “deposit marketplace” from Berlin, declared its intention to set up shop in America. Within a year Raisin hopes to follow its compatriot, N26, a mobile bank that is due to open there soon. Yet neither will, technically, be a bank. Remarkably, no such startup yet has a national banking charter in America, although the country is a hotbed of financial technology, spawning innovators from PayPal to Quicken Loans. 
Both Raisin and N26 will rely, at least at first, on the charters and deposit insurance of local “sponsor” banks. That route is “fastest to market”, says Nicolas Kopp of N26. It is also common. Sponsors such as the Bancorp Bank, Cross River Bank and WebBank stand behind fintechs and others wanting to offer banking services. (They often supply technology, too.) 
Varo Bank, of Salt Lake City (hitherto a partner of Bancorp), is likely to be the first purely mobile bank with a national charter. Last August the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a supervisor, gave Varo preliminary approval, subject to its raising $104m in capital and other conditions. Varo will also need a nod from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which it first approached in early 2017. Robinhood, an online wealth-manager, has also applied to the OCC and Square, which handles payments for small businesses (the chairman of The Economist Group, Paul Deighton, is on its board), to the FDIC. 
In Australia, Britain, Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere, online banks and other fintechs have a fairly clear path to regulatory approval. Regulators have provided “sandboxes” in which startups can develop their products safely. In Britain, online challengers have restricted licences at first; some, such as Monzo and Starling, have gained full bank status. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the OCC have proposed setting up sandboxes. Arizona, Utah and Wyoming, all eager to attract startups, are building their own. But although things are starting to shift, America is still far behind. It also has no equivalent of the European Union’s payment-services directive, which allows third-party companies to make payments and aggregate data from accounts—with consumers’ permission—or the British variant, Open Banking. Both may help open up banking to digital competition. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, has proposed modernising the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), an anti-discrimination law whose requirements are tied largely to the location of branches—hard to square with a world of digital banking—but nothing has changed yet. 
America’s regulatory system is fiendishly complex, comprising “patchworks on patchworks”, says Brian Knight of the Mercatus Centre at George Mason University. As well as several federal regulators, created in response to successive crises—the OCC during the civil war, then the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the CFPB and more—every state has its own authorities. 
Overseeing digital banks is thus no one’s business and everyone’s. The OCC has tried to take the initiative—last year it invited applications for “special purpose national bank charters” aimed at fintechs—but state regulators took umbrage, though the charter does not permit deposit-taking and none has been awarded. On May 2nd a federal court ruled that New York’s Department of Financial Services could proceed with a suit against the OCC. The prospect of a legal battle, progressing at much less than internet speed, may well put off potential applicants for special charters. 
Would-be banks have plenty of options, but all have pitfalls. As Varo Bank has found, the route to a conventional federal charter is slow (it went for a full OCC charter, not the limited special version). Hooking up with a sponsor buys time and convenience, but at some expense (eg, a cut of “interchange” fees from card transactions). Digital firms can buy a chartered bank, if they can find a suitable one: Moven, another fintech, has made three unsuccessful attempts, says Brett King, its founder. The biggest obstacle, he adds, was that the CRA would have obliged it to keep branches open. (Moven maintains a partnership with a bank in Kansas.) Or they can be bought themselves. Simple, a digital bank set up after the financial crisis to provide basic bank accounts, at first tied up with Bancorp, but in 2016 was acquired by BBVA, a Spanish bank already active in America. 
Admittedly, new banks face similar choices in other countries. At first N26 piggybacked on the licence of Wirecard, a German financial-services firm. Raisin’s domestic sponsor was MHB Bank—which it bought this March. Nevertheless, the sheer thickness of America’s regulatory undergrowth surely hands an advantage to already-licensed banks of all sizes. Several have their own online brands. 
Thus the most prominent digital entrant is arguably Goldman Sachs. Its offshoot, Marcus, has scooped $35bn in deposits, helped by a famous name and generous interest rates. Ally Financial, the biggest online-only bank, used to be General Motors’ financial arm. Meanwhile BankMobile, owned by Customers Bank, a Pennsylvanian lender with just $10bn in assets, has 2m checking-account customers; most are students, thanks to deals with their colleges. In April BankMobile launched T-Mobile MONEY, providing banking services under the telecoms network’s brand. Luvleen Sidhu, BankMobile’s president, says she is gaining 5,000 accounts a week—against just one through a typical bank branch. “Our path was easier”, says Ms Sidhu, “because we didn’t have to apply for a bank charter.”
