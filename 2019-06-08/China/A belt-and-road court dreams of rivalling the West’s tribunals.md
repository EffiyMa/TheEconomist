THREE WORDS—Fairness, Professionalism, Convenience—form a mission statement for the China International Commercial Court, which held its first public hearing in Xi’an on May 29th. When Chaguan attended the session, alongside foreign diplomats and representatives of China’s Supreme People’s Court, that three-word promise in English and Chinese shone from a digital screen dominating the bronze and marble entrance hall of this, China’s newest judicial institution. 
It is built to impress, for it has large ambitions. It was founded to buttress the railways, roads and fibre-optic cables of the Belt and Road Initiative—a globe-spanning scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping—with something less visible: a distinctively Chinese vision of how laws should govern globalised commerce. The court has two tribunals. The one in Xi’an is in a symbolic spot. The city was the historic terminus for jingling, snorting camel trains on trade routes later dubbed the Silk Road. Its sister tribunal in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen will hear disputes relating to maritime routes of Mr Xi’s project. Yet for all the pomp, the new court has an uncertain future, clouded by doubts about how many firms will agree to use it—though its remit now extends to large disputes involving foreign businesses, not just belt-and-road deals. The doubts are related to a fourth word dear to Communist leaders but missing from courthouse digital screens: control. 
A desire for this has made officials exceedingly cautious when crafting the court’s rules. Other judicial bodies dealing with international commercial cases have opened in recent years from Dubai to Singapore and the Netherlands. To signal their independence, they typically employ judges from several countries. Leading lawyers urged China’s supreme court to consider similar bold steps when setting up the new tribunals, playing on its desire to make the judiciary more worldly and better-trained. But officials at China’s legislature balked at changing the law to allow foreign judges to sit in the new court. Instead the tribunals will borrow supreme-court judges. Hearings will be conducted in Chinese by Chinese lawyers, though evidence written in English is allowed. 
The belt-and-road court is part of the supreme court. It has appointed an “expert committee” with 32, mostly foreign, members. But their role is only to advise the tribunals and to mediate should parties prefer to avoid litigation. A French member, Tao Jingzhou, who heads the China practice of Dechert, a law firm, laments in a new paper that the court is “constrained in many ways”. 
Shan Wenhua, another of the court’s advisers, fielded reporters’ questions on opening day in Xi’an. Professor Shan, who is dean of the law school at Xi’an Jiaotong University, assured Chaguan that the court’s Chinese judges would “administer justice independently from any interference”. He compared the new institution favourably to commercial courts and arbitration tribunals in London or Singapore, noting that it will offer the choice of formal litigation, arbitration or mediation, all under one roof. Answering questions from Chinese state media, the professor went further. Chinese businesses face “great risks” in belt-and-road countries where legal systems are not of “very high” quality, he explained. In addition, having to rely on foreign legal systems is “out of keeping with our status as a major power,” he said. “We have a shot at creating a better system.” 
It is easier to grasp the scale of China’s ambitions than to understand what international commercial law with Chinese characteristics might look like. In March the supreme court’s president, Zhou Qiang, delivered his annual report to the legislature. Item one was a pledge to uphold the Communist Party’s “absolute leadership” over the work of Chinese courts—for China rejects judicial independence, calling it a false Western ideal. Mr Zhou also called for strict implementation of rules requiring judges to seek Communist leaders’ instructions when “major matters” arise. Mr Zhou’s comments raise questions about the new belt-and-road tribunals, Susan Finder, one of the court’s expert advisers, has written on her influential blog, Supreme People’s Court Monitor. 
Some motives to have more foreign cases heard in mainland China may be relatively benign. For instance, autocratic Chinese business bosses, notably from state-owned enterprises, loathe being cross-examined in foreign commercial courts or arbitration tribunals, and often do badly there. Other possible motives are more worrying. Too many belt-and-road contracts are secretive, unequal and reward local power-brokers in opaque ways, reflecting deep cynicism about global norms. Some experts wonder if China secretly envies the ability of American judges in civil suits to demand the seizure of assets on the other side of the world. Though Chinese officials denounce America as a bully with a long reach, some scholars wonder whether China might one day begin issuing more extraterritorial judgments of its own. 
International lawyers expect rich-world parties to be wary of the tribunals, for now. They predict that foreign firms will prefer to take disputes involving Chinese partners to such compromise locations as Hong Kong, a Chinese city with its own legal system, complete with foreign judges. The opening case in Xi’an concerned a shareholding dispute involving Red Bull, an energy drink from Thailand. The case was passed to the tribunal by the supreme court. “Where you go to resolve a dispute is more or less a question of your bargaining power,” says a lawyer with years of China experience. Smaller firms from poorer nations have fewer choices. 
In the law courts of Communist China, power and political control count for more than fairness. The tribunals could one day matter a lot, should they be used to export a vision of international law that reflects that same, bleak worldview. At the moment, an obsession with power and order is hobbling the new tribunals. But that could change: China’s autocrats may not be as clumsy for ever. ◼
