“DIGITISATION WILL have the impact on supply chains that steam and electricity had on manufacturing,” declares Joe Terino of Bain. His claim seems hyperbolic, but it may yet prove prescient. Nearly 30 years after the internet first emerged as a tool for business, the management of supply chains at most MNCs, which do not operate in the rarefied air of Amazon and Alibaba, remains a surprisingly backward-looking, sluggish affair. 
The good news is that companies in many industries are experimenting with a variety of new technologies and methods that promise to improve how they plan, source, make and deliver. These innovations are making supply chains smarter by increasing their predictability, transparency and speed of delivery. 
First, to predictability. Firms have long used historical sales data to come up with demand forecasts, then manufactured and distributed according to the plan. This antiquated approach cannot keep pace with today’s on-demand economy. So firms are experimenting with AI to assess everything from social-media trends and shifts in demand to inventory turnover and vendor behaviour. Their goal is to fine-tune supply chains in real time. 
An annual survey by KPMG, a consultancy, and JDA, a supply-chain software firm, released in May, asked executives which technologies had the highest potential impact on supply chains and were most likely to be adopted. Cognitive analytics and AI came out on top, shooting up from their rankings the previous year. Blockchain and drones were down year-on-year. 
JDA uses deep-learning algorithms developed by Blue Yonder, a German startup it acquired that originally created the software for particle-physics experiments at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. Morrisons, a British grocery chain, reduced the incidence of out-of-stock items on its shelves by 30% and cut its inventory needs by several days by replacing manual stock planning with JDA’s AI system for demand forecasting and replenishment. 
ORSAY, a German fashion retailer, last year used JDA’s self-learning algorithm to make 112,000 autonomous pricing decisions. This enabled the firm to reduce the volume of stock that needed discounts of over 30% to sell. 
Intel, a big manufacturer of computer chips, estimates that it has already saved $58m through better forecast modelling. The firm uses so many bots (software that runs automated tasks) that it has created new bots to manage the worker-bots. One executive says that lawyers have been called in to decide whether management is liable for bad decisions made by boss-bots. 
McKinsey estimates that 40% of all procurement tasks (vendor management, order placement and invoice processing) can be automated today, and 80% soon; this could produce annual cost savings of 3-10%. All told, it reckons application of AI to supply-chain management and manufacturing could create $2trn of value. 
As for transparency, Adam Mussomeli of Deloitte, a consultancy, says that an age-old question still bedevils supply-chain managers: “Where’s my stuff?” This may seem surprising in an age of personal connectivity, smartphones and GPS, but it is still true. 
Pawan Joshi of E2Open, a supply-chain-software firm, explains why. Because of widespread outsourcing, typical MNCs do not make products (contract manufacturers do); they do not ship them (third-party logistics providers do); they do not store them (warehousing firms do) and they do not sell them (resellers and retailers do). So, he says, “the data needed to make real-time decisions are not inside the ecosystem of the manufacturer.” Data inside firms are also compartmentalised into specialised software used by different divisions. E2Open connects and makes sense of all these data. 
In November 2017 a strike by German cargo-handlers stranded a shipment of IBM mainframe computers at Frankfurt airport. Unable to track its precise location, the firm assumed the pricey cargo was safe inside an airport warehouse. In fact, it sat on an icy tarmac for nearly a month, exposed to blizzards. When it was eventually located, the kit—reportedly sitting in four inches of water—was a total write-off. 
The rise of the internet of things (IoT) will help. Sensors are coming onto the market that track not only the location of goods, but also the orientation of crates and factors such as temperature and humidity. In February IBM launched a “track and trace” service in partnership with Sigfox, an IoT service provider. Initially it will track only containers travelling from suppliers to factories run by Groupe PSA, a big French car manufacturer, but the service is to expand across Europe this year. 
Digital innovations from the top down and bottom up are making shipping smarter too. Singapore is building a massive new port that will expand its use of automated cranes and driverless vehicles. It has also launched an international effort to digitise trade. Tan Chong Meng, head of Singapore’s PSA, a giant port operator, explains that “like the SWIFT codes used in banking, we need common digital standards.” 
IBM and Maersk are using blockchain to try to make shipping paperless and transparent. Their TradeLens initiative got a big boost in May when CMA CGM and MSC, two big European shipping firms, joined. The consortium accounts for almost half the world’s cargo-container shipments. Every participant in the process, from shipper to customs agent to auditor, will be able to track shipments from start to finish by inspecting the relevant parts of the blockchain rather than ploughing through lots of paperwork. 
Standing at Flex’s Pulse command centre near Silicon Valley, Tom Linton looks every inch a commander-in-chief. The system gives him access to 92 variables from his supply chain in real time. Rather than hoard this intelligence, he shares it with employees, suppliers and clients on computers and mobile phones. 
His “data democracy” has decentralised a lot of decision-making and speeded up the flow of parts. In the first two years of using Pulse, Flex reduced inventory by 11 days and released $580m of cash. “The theory of everything is speed, and you need visibility to get velocity,” says Mr Linton. 
To deliver that speed, product design is undergoing a transformation. Spencer Fung is chief executive of Li & Fung, an Asian supply-chain firm that has helped Western MNCs with sourcing for over a century. Getting a new fashion item from paper sketch to the high street used to take 40 weeks, he recalls. Now it can take half that. 
Ford’s Hau Thai-Tang says the use of 3D prototyping and digital design shortened the development of the new Mustang GT500, a sports car, by 18 months. Carbon, a Californian 3D-printing unicorn rumoured to be considering a public flotation, is now printing parts used on production lines that produce hundreds of thousands of Ford vehicles and Adidas running shoes a year. 
Logistics innovators are harnessing platform technologies like those pioneered by Uber and Airbnb. Warehouse Exchange, a startup, matches owners offering slivers of warehouses on short-term contracts to firms with uncertain or highly fluctuating storage needs. UPS, a big American courier, last year launched Ware2Go, a platform that connects firms with warehouse space, inventory management and other logistics services. 
Fast Radius, a Chicago-based unicorn, has an advanced manufacturing facility located at a big shipping hub in Kentucky run by UPS, one of its investors. Its secret weapon is a collection of 3D printers from top manufacturers. An aerospace firm urgently needed a tool to restart production. Making and shipping it using normal manufacturing methods would have taken 45 days. Lou Rassey, Fast Radius’s boss, says his firm got the digital file, printed the tool and delivered it via UPS, all within two days. 
“Digitisation will have the impact on supply chains that steam and electricity had on manufacturing” 
At a busy warehouse in Yantian, a port district in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, Flexport, a Californian firm, is digitising the freight-forwarding business. As lorries arrive at the loading bay, cargoes are measured digitally, with no manual entries or paper forms, to capture dimensions straight to handheld devices and the cloud. Every pallet is barcoded and weighed on a digital scale. Computer vision turns analogue forms into digitally searchable ones, and machine learning (ML) optimises loading. Flexport reached a valuation of $3.2bn after a $1bn investment by Japan’s SoftBank in February. Ryan Petersen, its boss, argues that the old model of shipping 40ft-containerloads of a single product from China to a handful of big distribution centres in America or Europe cannot meet today’s demands for endless variety and speedy delivery. 
Rivals send containers across the Pacific to America that are only 65% full. Because his firm digitises packing lists using ML and can run real-time analytics, it is often able to fill the empty third of the container quickly with smaller loads also waiting to ship. To match supply and demand in smaller and varied shipments, says Mr Petersen, “brains, spreadsheets and phone calls aren’t enough. You need technology and data to make decisions right.” 
Dave Clark, a senior operations executive at Amazon, agrees. Supply-chain management has gone from a negotiation and procurement job to a technology and science function, he says. Two decades at the trailblazing firm have convinced him that managers introduce huge variability by relying on gut instincts. Rather than machines eliminating human labour downstream in the warehouse, as techno-pessimists fear, he sees a future in which ML replaces human judgment upstream in prediction and planning. He sums up Amazon’s thinking neatly: “We are a supply-chain technology company.”
