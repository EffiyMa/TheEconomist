FOR MOST of her life Anastasia Vasilieva had little interest in politics. She did not vote, considered Vladimir Putin “cool” and had never heard of Alexei Navalny, his political enemy. One of Moscow’s top eye specialists, she practised at a prestigious state clinic and, like most doctors in Russia’s state system, sometimes received gifts from wealthy patients, including businessmen, artists and even Kremlin officials. 
She first saw Mr Navalny (pictured) as a patient in April 2017, referred to her with a severe burn to his eye, the result of an acid attack by pro-Kremlin thugs. Ms Vasilieva managed to save the eye. A year later it was her turn to ask him for help. Thirty senior members of the medical staff at her clinic, including her mother, were made redundant as part of a cost-cutting exercise. Outraged, she posted on social media, wrote letters to Mr Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, but to no avail. The only person who helped was Mr Navalny. He provided lawyers who managed to get the redundant staff reinstated. 
Mr Navalny, who has been trying to tap into a large pool of frustrated public-sector workers, persuaded Ms Vasilieva to set up an independent doctors’ union. He gave her advice and supplied her with professional cameramen. Soon a YouTube channel, “Doctors’ Alliance”, started to show videos of Ms Vasilieva barging her way into provincial hospitals, exposing the dire state of care and the lack of basic drugs, and insisting on the public’s rights. She has called for strikes and publicly criticised hospital bosses. Though the alliance is small, with only 500 members, its social-media impact is much larger, she says. 
Tall, elegantly dressed and confidently hyperactive, Ms Vasilieva has become the face of Mr Navalny’s efforts to revitalise Russia’s trade unions and win support from a vast pool of workers and government employees who have long been ignored by liberal politicians. Having emerged as a leader of protests staged by the urban middle class in 2011-12, Mr Navalny has now taken a left turn, focusing on workers’ and citizens’ rights, not more abstract questions of democracy. “I am trying to show that a democratic agenda means not just talking about human rights and freedom of speech, but also about people’s salaries,” he says. 
The fall in living standards over the past five years, and an unpopular increase in the pension age, have produced a demand for a new centre-left political force. According to a recent report by the Centre for Analysis and Prevention of Conflicts (CAPC), an independent think-tank, some 40% of Russians sympathise with left-wing ideas and feel that none of the established political parties satisfy their needs. 
Mr Putin’s ruling United Russia is increasingly seen as a party of “crooks and thieves”, as Mr Navalny calls it, acting in the interest of the nomenklatura and the business oligarchy. The Communist Party, the second-largest official party, has long been fully integrated into the Kremlin’s political system, and appeals mainly to pensioners nostalgic for the Soviet Union rather than campaigning for social justice. Russia’s liberal intelligentsia has traditionally shunned working people. “Nobody [in the opposition] has ever worked with these people—neither the democrats nor the Communists,” says Mr Navalny. 
By reframing his discourse around working conditions and wages, Mr Navalny hopes to open up his appeal to a far greater segment of the population than just the urban middle classes, even if he is starting his efforts with government employees. Russia’s working class, including both skilled and unskilled labour and people employed in agriculture and transport, accounts for 27m people, nearly 40% of the entire working population of the country. Many of them feel abandoned and unrepresented, and do not bother to vote. 
The Kremlin portrays the working class as a conservative group, susceptible to nationalist rhetoric. Yet focus groups run by the CAPC reveal that opinions among the working class are similar to those among higher earners. Russian workers of all levels are wary of Mr Putin’s foreign adventures, seeing them as detrimental to their interests and only serving those of the ruling elite. They are not receptive to tub-thumping about patriotism and greatness, which is sometimes described as an opioid designed to divert attention from the core problems of injustice and corruption. Few lower-paid workers yet see Mr Navalny as their leader, though. 
In the Soviet Union trade unions were part of the bureaucracy. In today’s Russia the two largest trade-union organisations are affiliated with the pro-Kremlin parties. But some union activists see Mr Navalny as offering a chance to increase their leverage. “If Navalny shifts to the left, it is good for our cause,” says Oleg Shein, the leader of one of Russia’s largest trade-union organisations, with 700,000 members. 
So far, Mr Navalny has focused his campaign for improving workers’ rights on public-sector workers—especially health workers and teachers, who together comprise about 6m employees. “Firstly, these people are super-communicators, each of them comes into contact with patients and parents,” he explains. Second, they have been promised substantial pay rises by Mr Putin and feel let down. 
Mr Navalny stands to benefit either way. If the government increases salaries as it has promised, he will take the credit for making it do so; if it doesn’t, people will get angrier. “We want to show that Putin’s support base is now our support base,” he says. “Until we can win over these people, we can only dream of victory.”
