# AMLO’s populism is both rampant and constrained

ON JULY 1ST Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s president, celebrated the anniversary of his landslide election victory by addressing thousands of supporters from a podium in front of the Cathedral in the Zócalo, a vast square in Mexico City. “It wasn’t a simple change of government,” he told them. “It was to overcome forever the corrupt and pitiless regime that prevailed.” His aim is to eradicate corruption, cronyism and “neoliberalism” and to create a more equal society. He has not disappointed his supporters. But many of his critics are alarmed by the direction in which he is taking his country. 
His victory, at the third attempt, was a consequence of the failings of his predecessors. The economy has been better at producing billionaire monopolists than broad-based prosperity, while violent crime has surged. During the government of Enrique Peña (2012-18) corruption became blatant. 
AMLO, as the president is often known, owes his popularity—a poll this week put his approval rating at 66%—to his mastery of political symbolism. He has made personal austerity a trademark: he spurned the presidential residence, abolished the presidential guard, takes commercial flights and cut his salary. He takes the same approach to his government. “We can’t have a rich government with a poor people,” he said in the Zócalo. All this has helped to persuade many ordinary Mexicans that he has their interests, rather than his own, at heart. 
Since formally taking office in December, AMLO has quickly put his stamp on policy. This week a new 70,000-strong National Guard, mainly of former army conscripts, began to deploy to 150 of the most violent localities across the country. This is a sensible innovation, but not a comprehensive security strategy, and some worry about the guard’s military character. He has taken swipes at projects which he identifies with fat cats. He cancelled a half-built new airport in Mexico City, claiming it was marred by corruption. His government is seeking to renegotiate contracts for vital gas pipelines previously awarded to private energy companies. 
The crux of AMLO’s strategy is to bend the state to his political project, by redirecting public spending. He has slashed the running costs of government while ramping up social spending, especially on non-contributory pensions. He has shut down Prospera, a successful conditional cash-transfer scheme, and eliminated federal subsidies for day nurseries. In their place, he has set up several new cash-transfer programmes, including stipends for mothers, youngsters and the disabled. 
Giving money directly, rather than to providers like the nurseries, cuts out corruption, he says (it also happens to be a “neoliberal” approach). His critics see it as clientelist populism: the new schemes are identified with the president himself. The list of beneficiaries has been drawn up by 17,500 “Servants of the Nation” from Morena, AMLO’s political movement. They report to Gabriel García Hernández, AMLO’s shadowy right-hand man, who is said to be a devotee of Ernesto Laclau, an Argentine theorist of populism. The critics see this as part of a broader weakening of Mexican institutions. There are fewer competent civil servants, there is less transparency, less public information and the president scorns official information, says María Amparo Casar of CIDE, a university. 
AMLO’s populism faces constraints. The biggest is the dependence of Mexico’s economy on a trade agreement with the United States. That was underlined when President Donald Trump last month threatened to levy tariffs on Mexico’s exports unless its government cracked down on Central American migrants, which it quickly agreed to do. 
Second, AMLO has pledged macroeconomic stability and to maintain the value of the peso. So far he has stuck to that, at the expense of economic growth, which is unlikely to exceed 1% this year. That is partly because business, suspicious of AMLO’s intentions, is not investing. Third, he lacks the two-thirds majority in the Senate required to change the constitution. And Morena itself is a broad and loose movement rather than a disciplined party. 
AMLO’s sights are set on a mid-term election in 2021. If he increases his parliamentary majority, some of those constraints might fade. But some government officials know that too much populist anti-capitalism risks losing the middle-class support he won a year ago. “He’s an activist whom we want to turn into a statesman,” says one. On this battle for AMLO’s soul hinges Mexico’s future.
